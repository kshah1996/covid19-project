# **Introduction**
(Background on Covid and a short description of difficulties in making real-time predictions as well as why we wanted to do this project/what we hypothesized)

# **Project Goal**

To predict the number of new cases of Covid-19 a country can expect on a chosen day given that country's previous number of recorded cases and a few measurable variables specific to that country that may affect the spread of cases.


# **Data**

## *Raw Data*


### Hopkinâ€™s COVID-19 Data
(give brief description of dataset)

### World Bank Data
(give brief discussion and talk about decision to add this data as covariates in model)

### Global Health Index Data
(give brief discussion and talk about decision to add this data as covariates in model)

## *Data Processing*
(Data processing summary - should discuss joining Covid data with country data from the other sources mentioned above)

## *Finalized Data*
(give a peak at our final data - maybe pick a country or two and show the data we will use from that country in our model?)

# **Packaging**
(description of our R package - functions and datasets it holds)

# **Methods**

## *Poisson GLMM*
(describe GLMM model that we are modeling from scratch)

## *Machine Learning Method*
(describe machine learning method used)

## *Model Evaluation*
(describe how we evaluated our model prediction and include comparison of Module 2/Module 3 methods)

# **Results**

## *Poisson GLMM*

## *Machine Learning*

## *Comparison on Methods*

# **Discussion**
(give brief summary of what was shown in the results section and add in any subjective thoughts.)

## *Limitations*
(This could go on for pages - will try to focus on a brief description. Discussed including one or two plots, such as South Korea, to show some limitations)

# **References**
(add in any articles we referenced, websites where data came from, etc.)
